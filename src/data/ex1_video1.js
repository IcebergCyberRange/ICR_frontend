Find the Event Type in the SIEM dashboard and create a directive that sets off an alarm with the name <strong class="is-json">Log File Manipulation</strong> and the id <strong class="is-json">4</strong>  every time this Event Type comes up.

     'In TaskTwo you have already seen a very <strong>similar directive </strong> which is now already displayed in the Editor. Create a new directive by modifying this directive. As this is a new alarm, you not only need to change name and plugin_sid in the Rule Section according to the Event Type but also name and id of the alarm in the Directive Header. JSON is <strong>case sensitive</strong> so there is a difference whether something is spelled in upper or smaller case.',
